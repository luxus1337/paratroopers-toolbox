# paratroopers-toolbox
Hello Paratrooper!

First you will need to install the following programs:
* A terminal (on windows I would recommend cmder, http://cmder.net/)
* VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* A browser Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)
* Node (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Now lets create our first game please check out this repostiory by running the following command in CMDer (or your terminal of choice) in a folder where you want your paratroopers' projects to be (in the example this is ~/_paratroopers/):

**** Protip: "~" stands for your home directory


To create a folder u can use "mkdir"
```
mkdir _paratroopers
```
Then go to the directory and clone the repository

```
cd ~/_paratroopers/
git clone git@github.com:luxus1337/paratroopers-toolbox.git
```
